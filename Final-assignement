Part 2: Inferences and Analysis
1. Pick one city and category of your choice and group the businesses
in that city or category by their overall star rating. Compare the
businesses with 2-3 stars to the businesses with 4-5 stars and answer
the following questions. Include your code.
i. Do the two groups you chose to analyze have a different
distribution of hours?
Yes, but there is not a tend depending of the star rating. For
instance, those businesses with 2 stars opens at 11:00 and close at
23:00, while those with 3.0 closes at 4:00. The group with 4-5 stars
closes at the same time.
+---------+-------+-------------+----------------------+
| city | stars | category | hours |
+---------+-------+-------------+----------------------+
| Toronto | 2.0 | Restaurants | Saturday|11:00-23:00 |
| Toronto | 3.0 | Restaurants | Saturday|10:00-4:00 |
| Toronto | 4.0 | Restaurants | Saturday|18:00-23:00 |
| Toronto | 4.5 | Restaurants | Saturday|11:00-23:00 |
+---------+-------+-------------+----------------------+
ii. Do the two groups you chose to analyze have a different number of
reviews?

Yes, the group with 4-5 stars has more reviews (by little)
+---------+-------+---------------------+-------------+----------------------+
| city | stars | SUM(b.review_count) | category | hours |
+---------+-------+---------------------+-------------+----------------------+
| Toronto | 2.0 | 35 | Restaurants | Saturday|11:00-23:00 |
| Toronto | 3.0 | 567 | Restaurants | Saturday|10:00-4:00 |
| Toronto | 4.0 | 445 | Restaurants | Saturday|18:00-23:00 |
| Toronto | 4.5 | 238 | Restaurants | Saturday|11:00-23:00 |
+---------+-------+---------------------+-------------+----------------------+
iii. Are you able to infer anything from the location data provided
between these two groups? Explain.
No, they have different locations.
+---------+-------+-----------------------+---------------------+-------------
+----------------------+
| city | stars | address | SUM(b.review_count) | category| hours |
+---------+-------+-----------------------+---------------------+-------------
+----------------------+
| Toronto | 2.0 | 389 Church Street | 35 | Restaurants
| Saturday|11:00-23:00 |
| Toronto | 3.0 | 270 Adelaide Street W | 567 | Restaurants
| Saturday|10:00-4:00 |
| Toronto | 4.0 | 169 Niagara Street | 445 | Restaurants
| Saturday|18:00-23:00 |
| Toronto | 4.5 | 5084 Dundas Street W | 238 | Restaurants
| Saturday|11:00-23:00 |
+---------+-------+-----------------------+---------------------+-------------
+----------------------+

SQL code used for analysis:
Select
b.city,
b.stars,
b.address,
SUM(b.review_count),
c.category,
h.hours
From Business b
INNER JOIN Category C
ON (b.id=c.business_id)
INNER JOIN Hours h
ON (c.business_id=h.business_id)
Where b.City="Toronto" AND c.category ="Restaurants"
Group by b.stars

2. Group business based on the ones that are open and the ones that
are closed. What differences can you find between the ones that are
still open and the ones that are closed? List at least two differences
and the SQL code you used to arrive at your answer.
i. Difference 1:
The businesses that are still open has on average a bit higher stars
rating than those that are not open

ii. Difference 2:

The businesses that are still open has way more reviews in total than
those that are not open
+-------------------+---------------+---------+
| SUM(review_count) | AVG(stars) | is_open |
+-------------------+---------------+---------+
| 35261 | 3.52039473684 | 0 |
| 269300 | 3.67900943396 | 1 |
+-------------------+---------------+---------+
SQL code used for analysis:
Select
name,
SUM(review_count),
AVG(stars),
is_open
From business
Group by is_open

3. For this last part of your analysis, you are going to choose the
type of analysis you want to conduct on the Yelp dataset and are going
to prepare the data for analysis.
Ideas for analysis include: Parsing out keywords and business
attributes for sentiment analysis, clustering businesses to find
commonalities or anomalies between them, predicting the overall star
rating for a business, predicting the number of fans a user will have,
and so on. These are just a few examples to get you started, so feel
free to be creative and come up with your own problem you want to
solve. Provide answers, in-line, to all of the following:
i. Indicate the type of analysis you chose to do:
Get to know the relationship between the reviews count, the stars and
the top 10 categories with the highest number of businesses on each so
that Yelp might be able to identify which category should they be
putting more effort, or try to get more clients in those categories
with lowest number of businesses but high stars average or reviews.

ii. Write 1-2 brief paragraphs on the type of data you will need for
your analysis and why you chose that data:

For this analysis I will need first at all the category of each
business, in this case I will filter the top 10 categories with the
highest number of businesses.
I might also need the reviews that each category has in terms of
counting and also the average of the stars given for the users to the
category, so that I would be able to determinate and predict the
preferences of Yelps users and a contribution to the information they
might need in order to improve their service.
iii. Output of your finished dataset:


iv. Provide the SQL code you used to create your final dataset:
Select 
c.category,
b.review_count,
Count(b.name) as number_of_businesses,
AVG(b.stars) as stars_category
FROM Category c INNER JOIN Business b ON c.business_id=b.id
Group by c.category
Order by number_of_businesses DESC
Limit 10
